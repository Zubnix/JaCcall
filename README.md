Intro
=====

Playground for what is supposed to be a library similar to BridJ or JNA.

Goals are:
 - Simple usage.
 - Simple runtime API.
 - No config files.
 - Only C.
 - Linux only initially.
 - Support for Win/Lin/Mac - x86, x86_64, armsf, armhf.
 - Support for all common use cases: unions, callbacks, pointer-to-pointer, ...
 - Compile time annotation processor gathers all statically inferable information and generates runtime API independent code.

Jaccall's tries not to be Java, but instead tries to bring C to the world of Java.
This means:
 - No automatic garbage collection. What you allocate, you must free yourself.
 - Cast to and from anything to anything.
 - Read to and from anything to anything. Watch out for segfaults!

Pointer API
==========

Let's start with a simple example.

C
```C
...
size_t int_size = sizeof(int);
void* void_p = malloc(int_size);
int* int_p = (int*) void_p;
...
free(int_p);
```
This example is pretty self explenatory. A new block of memory is allocated of size 'int'. This block of memory is then cast to a pointer of type int, and finally the memory is cleaned up.

Using Jaccall this translates to
```Java
//(Optional) Define a static import of the Pointer and Size classes 
//to avoid prefixing all static method calls.
import static com.github.zubnix.jaccall.Pointer.*
import static com.github.zubnix.jaccall.Size.*
...
//Calculate the size of Java type `Integer` wich corresponds to a C int.
int int_size = sizeof((Integer)null);
//Allocate a new block of memory, using `int_size` as it's size.
Pointer<Void> void_p = malloc(int_size);
//Do a pointer cast of the void pointer `void_p` to a pointer of type `Integer`.
Pointer<Integer> int_p = void_p.castp(Integer.class);
...
//free the memory pointed to by `int_p`
int_p.close();
```
