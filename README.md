Playground for what is supposed to be a library similar to BridJ or JNA.

Goals are:
 - Simple usage.
 - Simple runtime API.
 - No config files.
 - Only C.
 - Linux only initially.
 - Support for Win/Lin/Mac - x86, x86_64, armsf, armhf.
 - Support for all common use cases: unions, callbacks, pointer-to-pointer, ...
 - Compile time annotation processor gathers all statically inferable information and generates runtime API independent code.
